    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>This was my first ever attempt at building a website using Pythons framework Flask. It is a simple layout using HTML/CSS but there is a lot of 
        functionality behind it. It is running several MySQL databases storing user login information, admin login information, family members information, 
        information on the images and documents databases where signed in and approved users can search through the stored items. There is also a function where
        a new user signing up has to be approved by admin on site before being able to log in and is sent an custom email right after signing up letting the 
        user know they are waiting for approval. And will be sent another custom email for both outcomes.</p>

    <p>But not anyone can come to the site and start looking around. Many of the pages are blocked off and if a non-authorized user tries to click on a page that is only
        for authorized users they will be redirected to the login page where they can log in or sign up. </p>

    <p>Once a user is approved and has logged in they can search through the site, one of the things they can search through is a documents database that holds information
        about documents. Including the name of the doucment, description and cloud url that is the actual image.
